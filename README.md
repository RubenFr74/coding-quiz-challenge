# Coding Quiz Challenge

## About

This is a small coding qiz game I've made through the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript from the lessons we have gone through in the Coding Bootcamp
I am currently attending. It is only five questions long and they pertains only to questions about what we've learned so far. 

It tracks your quiz score and also has a high score page that will reveal the top 5 high scores of the webpage. But if you get an incorrect answer, the 
timer will go down 5 seconds and when the timer runs out the quiz is over.

The experience making this was very enlightening, I'm fairly new to coding so disvering you can make multiple pages of html, css, and js was eye opening.
If you would like to see how the website looks and works like just click on the link [here](https://rubenfr74.github.io/coding-quiz-challenge/).
